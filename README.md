Hi ðŸ‘‹! Here is **Meirui Jiang**, I am currently a Post-doctoral Fellow at the [CSE](http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/), [CUHK](http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/). 

I'm currently on the job market. Please reach out if you think I would be a good fit. Thank you!

My research centers around the intersection of machine learning and healthcare, with a particular focus on medical image analysis. I am driven by a strong desire to enhance the applicability of machine learning algorithms, with a focus on their robustness, efficiency, generalizability, reliability, and privacy. In particular, I am passionate about leveraging large distributed datasets to empower real-world applications in the healthcare domain. By exploring this interdisciplinary realm, I aim to contribute to advancing machine learning techniques and their transformative impact on healthcare practices.

I am always open to engaging in discussions and collaborations. Please feel free to reach out to me via email :)

Please learn more about me from my [personal website](https://meiruijiang.github.io/MeiruiJiang/).
